### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I really enjoy contributing to technological products that help people. And I hope that one day I can inspire new generations to do the same.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on something great, the best project I have: myself.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more Java, Swift, Android, iOS, Spring Framework and always learning something new.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on a project with you if you want to.
